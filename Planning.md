# Ludum Dare 54

## Limited Space

### Initial Planning
- Limited inventory space
  - Only able to carry one object (doesn't heavily rely on the theme)
- Limited physical space
  - Play-area gets smaller as the game progresses
	- Control a space ship tasked with collecting resources. The space bar is used to propel the ship, however you must return to the main station with enough resources to refuel. However, the fuel is always less than you start with. How long  can you last?
	- Claustrophobia
	- Infinite runner (ironically unlimited space) in which the player must quickly run from a cave in.
	  - Godot 2D lighting?
	  - Involves moving between all directions (cave-in direction changes, "exit" screen of the runner can be any cardinal direction)
  - Play-area is small to begin with
- Limited use of the space bar
- Space / the Universe is limited
